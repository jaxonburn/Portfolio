          After 663 hours of in classroom coding time, I graduated from MTECH and high school. Part of completing the program was 240 hours of interning at a company. So I began my search to find an externship where I could really see what development was like on real projects.

          Shortly after I began my first interning fulltime at a small startup in Pleasant Grove called Ionrev. They began by having me learn Vue.js, Feathers.js(a express wrapper), and MongoDB. I spent half of my time learning and shadowing, and the other half helping develop their web apps.

          Due to my enrollment at the University of Utah I needed a job that was closer to school and so found a job as a backend python developer at Neutron Interactive. Here I work with the backend team using Django Rest Framework to optimize endpoints, improve queries to the database, and create new endpoints.
